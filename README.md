# Fall 2016 Internship Assessment

This project was initially completed for my assessment with xentientLabs LLC, now known as xentient.technology.

I had a very short time to complete the assessment but what I had initially was very old and code were unreadable. Formatting wasn't a thing really back in 2016. I'm currently working on fixing this up, to make this a vanilla kanban board.

To try it out, clone this repo and run `npm install`.

I used `parcel` to serve the `index.html`.

`npx parcel src/index.html`
